Revision history for Perl extension Business::OnlinePayment.

3.00_04  Tue Oct 10 12:49:43 PDT 2006
	- failure statues (see notes_for_module_writers_v3)
	- oops, forgot _03 changelog in _03
	- B:OP:HTTPS: require Net::SSLeay 1.30 and remove _my_https_post kludge
	- eliminate warnings about redefined subroutines
	- Business::FraudDetect and Business::FraudDetect::preCharge included
	- From Phil Lobbes:
	  - content() now returns empty hash if no content is defined
	  - build_subs now uses can() so it doesn't redefine subs (and generate
	    warnings)
	  - DOC: SYNOPSIS now uses correct "card_number" and not "cardnumber"
	  - created test cases for (all?) methods except _risk_detect
	    _pre_submit 
	  - Removed some old commented out 2.x statements
	  - set $VERSION using eval per modperlstyle
	  - new() now will strip off multiple leading dashes before calling
	    build_subs
	    NOTE: we should probably have it remove any \W to make perl happy
	  - required_fields() now croaks with a list of missing fields
	  - Lots of general cleanup, no functional changes. "fill
	    paragraphs" in POD, remove extra whitespace, sorted %fields,
	    dump_contents now sorts %contents, added myself to AUTHORS.
	- From Frederic Briere (closes: CPAN#21082):
	  - DOC: s/exp_date/expiration/
