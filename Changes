Revision history for Perl extension Business::OnlinePayment.

3.00_06  Tue Mar 13 12:26:04 PDT 2007
	- B:OP:HTTPS: add optional \%options (options hashref) to
	  https_get and https_post to allow modules using this to set
	  headers, etc. required for PayflowPro HTTP protocol support
	- B:OP:HTTPS: support setting Net::SSLeay "$mime_type6" argument
	- B:OP:HTTPS: pass $DEBUG value to $Net::SSLeay::trace (debug control)
        - new() now passes %data (processor data) to set_defaults
	- update B:OP:HTTPS to allow setting request headers
        - doc: list a bunch of previously undocumented fields

3.00_05  29 Nov 2006
	- Update Makefile.PL so Business::FraudDetect::preCharge is installed,
	  included by make dist, etc.
	- Phil Lobbes is responsible for the rest of the work in this release.
	  Thanks!
	  - Reworked _pre_submit functionality:
	    - Add Class data %WrappedSubmitClassMethod to remember "wrapped"
	      submit 
            - Fix new() to check %WrappedSubmitClassMethod to avoid creating
	      deep recursion 
            - Used feedback from MSCHWERN / Bug #22074 to cleanup
	      new/_pre_submit more
            - Now always wrap submit() method with _pre_submit() (but only
	      once)
	    - no longer populate _child_submit, code in anon sub was cleaned
	      up
	    - use return values from _pre_submit to determine if real submit
	      is called.  the return values from _pre_submit should be
	      reviewed/verified still
	    - _risk_detect(): explicity set return value
            - _pre_submit(): explicity set return value
	  - Updated tests:
	    - 8 new tests and 1 new "MOCK3" driver for testing _pre_submit()
	      functionality
            - test for new() replacing subclass submit and causing deep
	      recursion
	    - minor cleanup of test drivers
	    - fix "submit unchanged" test case: now wrapped with _pre_submit()
	      always
	  - Updated POD documentation:
            - Minor documentation change in print statements use ',' instead
	      of '.'         

3.00_04  Tue Oct 10 12:49:43 PDT 2006
	- failure statues (see notes_for_module_writers_v3)
	- oops, forgot _03 changelog in _03
	- B:OP:HTTPS: require Net::SSLeay 1.30 and remove _my_https_post kludge
	- eliminate warnings about redefined subroutines
	- Business::FraudDetect and Business::FraudDetect::preCharge included
	- From Phil Lobbes:
	  - content() now returns empty hash if no content is defined
	  - build_subs now uses can() so it doesn't redefine subs (and generate
	    warnings)
	  - DOC: SYNOPSIS now uses correct "card_number" and not "cardnumber"
	  - created test cases for (all?) methods except _risk_detect
	    _pre_submit 
	  - Removed some old commented out 2.x statements
	  - set $VERSION using eval per modperlstyle
	  - new() now will strip off multiple leading dashes before calling
	    build_subs
	    NOTE: we should probably have it remove any \W to make perl happy
	  - required_fields() now croaks with a list of missing fields
	  - Lots of general cleanup, no functional changes. "fill
	    paragraphs" in POD, remove extra whitespace, sorted %fields,
	    dump_contents now sorts %contents, added myself to AUTHORS.
	- From Frederic Briere (closes: CPAN#21082):
	  - DOC: s/exp_date/expiration/ 

3.00_03  Wed Mar 16 02:41:59 PST 2005

	  pairs
